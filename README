This project contains Python scripts to help with mass changes to S3 buckets.
Individually the scripts will allow you to download a copy of a bucket to a
local folder, upload a local folder (recursively) to an bucket, or delete every
file in a bucket.  Combining these scripts can allow you to clone one bucket to
another, even across S3 accounts.  There are faster ways to do that if you want
to clone a bucket within the same account.
